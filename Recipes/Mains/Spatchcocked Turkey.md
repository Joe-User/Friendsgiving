## Ingredients
### Turkey and Brine
1 Whole Turkey  
1/2 Cup - Kosher Salt  
1 tsp - Baking Powder

###  Compound Butter
1/2 lb - Unsalted Butter  
2 tsp - Dried Thyme  
2 tsp - Dried Sage  
2 tsp - Garlic Powder  
2 Tbsp - Minced Fresh Parsley  
2 tsp - Fresh Rosemary

### Bed of Vegetables
2 lb. - Carrots  
2 Bulbs - Garlic  
1 Celery  
4 Parsnip  
3 Turnip  
2 Onions

## Instructions
### Defrost
1. Defrost turkey in refrigerator this will take about 1 day for every 4 lbs

### Brine
1. After the turkey has been fully defrosted. Unwrap and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Using kitchen shears remove the spine of the turkey. Dispose or save for turkey stock.
3. Make a small snip on the inside of the breast bone. Turn turkey over on a flat surface and push on the center of the breast bone. The bone should break and the turkey will lie flat.
4. Separate skin from the meat being careful to not tear it. Work the skin away from the breasts and thighs.
5. Dry the turkey again with paper towels both inside and out. You need to turkey as dry as possible.
6. Mix 1/2 Cup of Kosher salt with 1 tsp of baking powder. Spread liberally over turkey making sure to apply under wings and thighs. Be sure to pat on vertical surfaces of the turkey to insure complete coverage.
7. Place turkey on a large baking sheet on top of baking racks to encourage air movement under the turkey.
8. Place turkey in refrigerator for at least 24 hours to brine.

### Compound Butter
1. In a mixer with the paddle attachment combine butter, salt thyme, sage, garlic powder, parsley, and rosemary until well combined.
2. Transfer butter to a container or form into a log using parchment paper or plastic wrap.
3. Refrigerate until needed.

### Prep Vegetables
1. Top, tail, and peel parsnips, and carrots and quarter or half to keep roughly the same size for even cooking. I like to cut them into 2-3 inch pieces so they can be easily removed and used as roasted vegetables.
2. Just before placing the turkey in the oven cut the bulbs of garlic in half across the cloves to let out the aromatics while cooking.
3. Top and tail celery and cut into roughly 2-3 inch pieces.
4. Top, tail and peel parsnips. Cut into roughly similar sizes as the other vegetables so that they all cook fairly evenly.
5. Cut onions into slices

### Prep 
1. Preheat oven to 400F
1. Remove turkey from refrigerator and rinse all of the salt off of the turkey with cold water.
2. Immediately pat dry inside and out with paper towels.
3. Soften compound butter and evenly spread under the skin. If there is any extra spread evenly on top of the skin.
4. Rinse off the baking sheet the turkey was brined on. 
5. In one layer evenly distribute the prepared vegetables on the baking sheet. Do not place more than one layer this can cause the turkey to cook unevenly. 
6. Place baking racks over the vegetables and place the turkey on top. Tuck the wing tips under the breasts of the turkey.
7. If available place temperature probes in the deepest part of the breast and thigh.

### Cook
1. Once oven had pre-heated to 400F. Place in center of oven.
2. If you have temperature probes make sure that they are placed in the deepest part of the thigh and breast. If not you can use an instant read thermometer to monitor the temperatures. Starting with the thigh then the breasts.
3. Cook the white meat (breast) to a max temperature of 155F and dark meat (wings and thighs) to a max temperature of 175F. [^1]
4. Once the dark or white meat approaches the target temperature remove the part and let the remaining part come to temperature. Remove the meat a little before the target temperature and allow to coast to the target. 
5. Once the turkey is up to the correct temperature debone and plate.
